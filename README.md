# r99c

generated using Luminus version "4.19"

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION!

`R99` was programmed with COMMON LISP by me in 2017.
I planed to version-up the old R99 to a single page application
with Clojure/Script, but recently gave up since R99 is natural to have
several pages, status, problems, new-answer, others-answers, comments,
and so on.

I love `Duct`. Also I am interested in `reitit`.
This time, I will try `luminus` to extend my Clojure world.
