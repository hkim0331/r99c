# r99c

generated using Luminus version "4.19"

R99 was programmed with COMMON LISP by me in 2017.
I planed to version-up the old R99 to a single page application
with ClojureScript, but recently gave up since R99 is natural to have
several pages, status, problems, new-answer, others-answers, comments,
and so on.

I love Duct, and also am interested in `reitit`.
So, luminus.
